The project was started by George Mason University's software engineering department with a goal to be different from other such pastebins by including features that would help developers more easily debug their code. As an intern in this team, I developed a feature that would enable developers to get a direct relationship between lines of Javascript and their corresponding output. Hovering over a line results in any visual element (text, image, etc) that is affected by that command or set of commands to be highlighted. Similarly, highlighting over such elements in the browser output emphasizes lines of code that directly changed the visual properties of that element. This especially is helpful for new developers to learn functions in Javascript that select multiple objects or manipulate visual properties in ways they are not familiar with. It also helps seasoned developers parse through longer snippets of code faster.</div><br><a href=https://github.com/Varun-Kulkarni/SeeCodeRun><button type=button class="btn btn-primary">Github</button></a></div></div><div class=row id=photon><div class=col-md-6 id=photon-content><div class=col-header>Photon</div><div>Photon is an app that I developed in my sophomore year of high school with two friends, beginning during the last month and continuing into that summer. By July of that year, the app was released on the apple app store under the author name of SPK Development (SPK being each of our last name's first letter). Photon was aimed to the audience of high schoolers and its purpose was to be a time management tool. The app features three parts:</div><div id=sub-bullets><ul><li>A task list to view current tasks and scheduling buttons to add those events to the calendar</li><li>A timer to show the remaining time for an event, such as a certain homework assignment</li><li>A future-view interface where events in the next three hours are shown in terms of arcs on a circle. Users can drag across arcs to get events at a specific time</li></ul></div><a href=https://github.com/Varun-Kulkarni/Photon><button type=button class="btn btn-primary">Github</button></a></div><div class=col-md-6><img src=images/photon.svg></div></div><div class=row id=web><div class=col-md-6 id=web-images><img src=images/tsa.png> <img src=images/igem.png></div><div class=col-md-6 id=web-content><div class=col-header>Web Design</div><div>My experience in web design can be summarized by three major sites (including this one), which I either developed in small teams or completely on my own. Typically in web design, I use libraries such as Bootstrap to help bolster my UI, and I use my graphic design experience to make visuals and diagrams for websites (which can be especially seen in the second site below). At my internship, I was exposed to more tools that would enhance my web development experience such as Gulp.js, so I use such tools when developing as well.</div><br><div class=websites-header>Access my sites!</div><a href=pages/tsa/TechEd.html><button type=button class="btn btn-primary">TSA Website</button></a> <a href=http://rockridgeigem.github.io><button type=button class="btn btn-primary">iGEM Website</button></a></div></div><div class=row id=robotics><div class=col-md-6 id=robotics-content><div class=col-header>FIRST Robotics</div><div>Since 5th grade, I've participated in FIRST Robotics, beginning with the FIRST Lego League and continuing all the way through the FIRST Robotics Challenge. Some of the highlights of my time in the FIRST Competition include advancing to the state competition three times in a row during FLL, becoming a finalist in the FIRST Tech Challenge, and earning awards in Robot Design from Rockwell Collins in the same competition.</div><div>In my senior year, I took part in FIRST Robotics Challenge with Team 5338, RoboLoCo. As part of the programming team in the team, I learned a lot about using commercial sensors and motors for robots, computer vision, and graphic design (which I used to make Roboloco's official logo for that season). From a mechanical perspective, I worked with new drive trains (such as swerve drive) and mechanisms for delivery of objects (like claws and RPM-based launchers). During this season, the team I worked on earned a Judges Award sponsored by Micron at the Chesapeake regional competition.</div></div><div class=col-md-6><div id=robotics-img-cont><div id=carousel_1 class="carousel slide"><div class=carousel-inner><div class="carousel-item active"><img src=images/53381.png></div><div class=carousel-item><img src=images/IMG_2120.jpg></div><div class=carousel-item><img src=images/IMG_2131.jpg></div><div class=carousel-item><img src=images/5338Programming.png></div></div><a href=#carousel_1 data-slide=prev role=button class=carousel-control-prev><span class=carousel-control-prev-icon aria-hidden=true></span> <span class=sr-only>Previous</span></a> <a href=#carousel_1 data-slide=next role=button class=carousel-control-next><span class=carousel-control-next-icon aria-hidden=true></span> <span class=sr-only>Next</span></a></div></div></div></div></section></section><div class=container-fluid id=resume-div><div class=col-8>Need a Resume?</div><a href=pages/resume.html><button type=button class="btn btn-dark">Click Here</button></a></div><section class=container-fluid id=footer><div class=row><div class=col><a href=mailto:kulkarni.varun22@gmail.com><span class=helper></span><img src=images/mailto.svg></a></div><div class=col><span class=helper></span><img src=images/poly-portrait.svg></div><div class=col><a href=http://github.com/varun-kulkarni><span class=helper></span><img src=images/gitLogo.svg></a></div></div></section><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js integrity=sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.6/umd/popper.min.js integrity=sha384-wHAiFfRlMFy6i5SRaxvfOCifBUQy1xHdJ/yoi7FRNXMRBu5WHdZYu1hA6ZOblgut crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.2.1/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity=sha384-B0UglyR+jN6CkvvICOB2joaf5I4l3gm9GU6Hc1og6Ls7i6U/mkkaduKaBhlAXv9k crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/typed.js@2.0.9></script><script type=text/javascript>
