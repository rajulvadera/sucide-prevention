			<h1>Rock Ridge Technology Education Courses</h1>
			
			<p class="area">One of the areas of CTE courses at Rock Ridge High School is the area of Technology Education.  These courses teach students about interacting with different kinds of technology and exploring technology related careers.  The courses focus on a large variety of areas from computer programming and data transfer to efficient and clean engineering.  CTE courses are definitely recommended for those thinking of going into fields of engineering, computer sciences, and modern technological design.</p> 
			
			<h2 class= "sub">Technology Education I &amp; II</h2> 
			<p class="textc">The Technology Education courses at our school involve students with lots of hands on activity and machinery in addition to a regular classroom environment relating to new technology. Tech Ed courses expose students to learn about new kinds of technology areas through a series of modules based on areas such as Manufacturing, Production, Clean Energy, Communications, Biotechnology, etc. Modules will expose students to using technology such as circuits, wind tunnels, and greenhouse models to analyze and make new products on their own. Along with this, students will take part in projects involving woodworking and metalworking using machinery such as laser cutters, precision sanders, drills, and other tools used in construction and design today. Tech Ed I and II encourage students to analyze technology in their lab activities and modules and use it safely in their woodworking projects. Projects include building small birdhouses, cars, and other wooden trinkets to large benches and stools. In some big projects, the class will give their products to the school for general use.</p> 

			<p class="minorText">Note: Next year, Technology Education I is changing its name to "Production Systems" and is being offered only in 12th Grade.  Technology Education II is changing its name to "Materials and Processes" and will become the first level of Technology Education for freshmen.  After Materials and Processes, students move on to "Manufacturing Systems I" &amp; "Manufacturing Systems II" before taking Production Systems</p>

Along with work in modules which teach them about other technology, most of the students' work is in the lab, where they test their skills in woodworking as well as their creativity. Some of the projects, such as large benches and sculptures, are given back to our school to decorate it.</figcaption>

				<figcaption class = "caption">This is the lab that technology education students use when woodworking.  It has many machines such as band saws, drill presses, planers, and other important tools</figcaption>

			<h2 class = "sub">Applied Technology I &amp; II</h2>
			<p class="textc">In Applied Tech, students develop more and more analysis skills with technology.  Students apply technology, along with their own creativity and knowledge to solve problems related to industry engineering and modern technologies.  More skills in mathematics, communication, and sciences are implemented into this course than
regular Technology Education, leading to more in-depth thinking and proof in ideas.  Students also study how fields such as biotechnology, energy, aerospace, and other fields relate to each other.  In addition, students are encouraged to use innovative thinking to tackle ideas and goals that our human race is currently investing time and money in, such as
space exploration, recycling, and environmental conservation with technology.</p> 
			<p class="minorText">Note: Next year, Applied Technology will be called "Technology Foundations".  Like this year, Technology Foundations will be offered any year (9-12).  Applied Technology II will also be offered by our school next year and will have the name "Technology Transfer".  In addition to this, our Applied Tech level III, which was not offered this year but will be next year, will go by the name "Technology Assessment"</p>

			<h2 class = "sub">Computer Aided Drafting &amp; Design (CADD)</h2>
			<p class="textc">With more and more new industries making new designs to products, especially for products such as cars, planes, and robots, things have planned out before they are built.  One such way of planning is Computer Aided Drafting &amp; Design (CADD) and this course teaches the basic principles and theories regarding design and graphics.  Students use software such as AutoCAD to learn the importance of designing before building.  CADD software such as AutoCAD and Creo allow for students to design products AND put stresses on them such as center of gravity and mass distribution of the product, and students learn how such tests are important to building products safely and efficiently.  CADD allows students to create anything they want. However in some cases in the real world there are restrictions such as material and cost.  This course allows students to learn how to best design with such restrictions and what kinds of things can be done to get over hurdles that they could face when designing in their careers.</p> 
			<p class="minorText">Note: Next year, CADD classes will also be having a different name.  They will be going by the name.  CADD I will be called "Technical Drawing and Design" and what was formerly CADD II (not offered this year) will be called "Architectural Drawing and Design".  Between these two will be a level that aids in the transition from Technical to Architectural. This middle level will be called "Engineering Drawing and Design".</p>
